			<h3>Cosmos</h3>
			<p>Cosmos is a web game -- created entirely using Javascript, HTML, and CSS -- that allows the user to interactively traverse a 'galaxy' on any browser-supported device. The user is a ball in the galaxy with the goal of surviving the longest (HIGH SCORE). You survive by avoiding contact with any bouncing white invaders. <p>Playing in SNIPER mode increases difficulty but comes with the ability to shoot and defeat the bubbles.</p><img src="https://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/442/611/datas/gallery.jpg"></p>
			<p>It was an enlightening experience creating the app - a relatively ambitious project for my first experience with the web and JavaScript.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5F0ICxwdEE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

			<h3>Ahh Cats I like them</h3>
			<p>The domestic cat[1][5] (Latin: Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.[6] Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds; different associations proclaim different num<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Cat_poster_1.jpg/1920px-Cat_poster_1.jpg"></p>

			<h3>Christmas Trees!</h3>
			<p>Leonhard Euler (/ˈɔɪlər/ oy-lər;[2] Swiss Standard German [ˈɔɪlər] ( listen), German Standard German [ˈɔʏlɐ] ( listen)) (15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician and engineer who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics like infinitesimal calculus and graph theory while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as topology and analytic number theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function.[3] He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.[4]<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Leonhard_Euler.jpg/440px-Leonhard_Euler.jpg"></p>
			<p>Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century, and is held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time. His collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes,[5] more than anybody in the field. He spent most of his adult life in St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.</p>
			<p>A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses Euler's influence on mathematics</p></p>

			<h3>'Tis the season to be jolly'!</h3>
			<p>"Deck the Halls" or "Deck the Hall" (which is the original version of the lyrics) is a traditional Christmas, yuletide, and New Years' carol. The melody is Welsh dating back to the sixteenth century,[1] and belongs to a winter carol, "Nos Galan", while the English lyrics date to 1862.<img src="https://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2016/holidays-2016-day-1-northern-hemisphere-5727116688621568-hp.gif"></p>
