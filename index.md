Greetings! I'm a Computer Science + Data Science double major at UC Berkeley and a TA for Berkeley's [Data Structures and Algorithms](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa18/) course. 

I'm passionate about CS education, exploring Artificial Intelligence (neural nets are so cool), and fascinated by how social patterns influence technological progress. 

Feel free to poke around to see what I've been up to.

If you want to get in touch, drop me a line at **carlo** at **berkeley.edu**
