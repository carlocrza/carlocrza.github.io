Greetings! I'm a Computer Science + Data Science double major at Berkeley and a TA for Berkeley's [Data Structures and Algorithms](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa18/) course. 

I'm passionate about CS education, exploring Artificial Intelligence (neural nets are so cool), and fascinated by how social patterns influence technological progress. 

Feel free to poke around to see what I've been up to.

**Students:** see [Teaching](/Teaching) for my teaching hours, appointment scheduling, lecture slides, and other resources.  


If you want to reach out for any reason, feel free to contact me at **carlo** at **berkeley.edu**
