Greetings! I'm a Computer Science + Data Science student at UC Berkeley. 

I also like to spend my time teaching. I'm an undergraduate student instructor for Berkeley's [Algorithms course](http://cs170.org) and have been a uGSI for CS 61B (Data Structures). 

I'm passionate about CS education and fascinated by how social patterns influence technological progress. 

Feel free to poke around to see what I've been up to.

If you want to get in touch, drop me a line at **carlo** at **berkeley.edu**
