Greetings! I'm a recent Computer Science + Data Science graduate from UC Berkeley. 

During my undergrad years I was an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI) for Berkeley's Data Structures course (CS61B) and upper div Algorithms course (CS170). You can find most of my teaching materials under [Teaching](/teaching).

I'm passionate about CS education and fascinated by how social patterns influence technological progress.
